        This Document is designed to teach you how to perform basic functions in Lightspeed. I will assume you already know how to log in to your account. So this guide will not included that function. If you are still confused about how to perform a specific funtion at the end of the guide, please consult with your IT department. If they don't know, then please call Lightspeed. If they don't know then you're just out of luck. But seriously, just email someone like me at <code>carson@shorelinemarine.com</code>
